This is my first heavy machine learning project. It is the kaggle titanic competition. As the name suggests, you try to predict the casualty of the Titanic using Random Forest and compare it against the actual number. 

This is more of a personal proejct so expect to see a lot of trials and errors as I also push my failed files onto github (as of writing i have restarted twice)
